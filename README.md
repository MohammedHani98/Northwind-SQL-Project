# Intro
These files demonstrate an application of different SQL techniques to gain insights from the Northwind Sales database.
## Northwind Database Creation
- The project starts with the creation of the database. The script for the database creation `Tables_Creation.sql` and `Inserting_values.sql` is mainly available at this <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/sample-data/northwind/">link</a>.
- I modified some points in the code to include some redundant values to be used for the purpose of the querying process.

## Northwind Database Querying
- `Querying.sql` file include the script to query and gain insights from the databse.
- *CTEs* and *window functions* are included in the file.

### Functions
- There is a file for created functions to b utilized since they are not orginally included in the MS SQL Server.
- These function are included in `Created_Functions.sql`.
